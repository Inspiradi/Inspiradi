## Hi there 👋

🌟 Inspiradi — AI That Inspires, Not Replaces

Inspiradi is a creative companion for artists and writers.
It’s built on one belief: inspiration should be abundant, accessible, and in your control.

✨ Vision

"AI that Inspires, Not Replaces."

Inspiradi helps creators overcome blocks and ignite imagination:

In-built Inspiration Library:

3 categories × 3 sub-categories × 20 inspirations + 2 categories x 2 sub-categories x 20 inspirations.

A Randomizer that blends three inspirations into new, unexpected sparks.

AI-free option — for artists who prefer pure human-made prompts.

AI-Assisted Buttons (optional):

Elaborate → Expand an idea.

Get Brief → Condense inspiration into a sharp, usable brief.

Generative Brief → Let AI remix and suggest unique creative directions without asistance from in-built library of inspirations. Meaning it's purely AI generated inspirations.

Creators stay in full control: use the in-built library, add randomness, or explore AI tools only if you want.

🛠 Features

Static HTML/CSS frontend — lightweight, fast, simple.

Netlify Functions (for securely handling AI API calls).

Manual inspiration library designed for artists.

Optional AI buttons integrated for deeper exploration.
